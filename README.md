# my_utils.py 
Purpose: contains a function get_column which uses the four variables file_name, query_column, query_value, result_column to pull specified data from a csv file and put the outputs within a list. 
file_name = the name of the csv file with the data you want to pull from
query_column = the column (indexed at 0) you want to pull from
query_value = the specific value you want to pull data for
result_column = the data from the value you selected

# Example of how to use my_utils
print_fires.py 
To use my_utils, use a main function that calls get_args, file_error, and get_column. 

In a shell script (run.sh), input the three required parameters file_name, query_column, and query_value. Optionally include result_column. 

Output in this example: list containing the number of fires in different years for only the Unites States of America. 

# Installing software
To install software, clone updated version from github. Use any csv file formatted where data is sorted by columns.
